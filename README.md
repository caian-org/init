## About

This playbook expects a fresh Manjaro-with-KDE installation. Much of it will
work as expected in other Arch-based distributions, as well on other desktop
environments (xfce, lxde, i3 etc). Some things, however, are very KDE-specific.

`workstation` makes use of:

- [`dots`][dots-url], my collection of *NIX configuration files
- [`bin`][bin-url], my collection of scripts, utilities, hacks, [...]

## Usage

```sh
curl -fsSL https://git.io/fjcFh | bash
```
