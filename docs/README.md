## About

 >"Rice" is a word that is commonly used to refer to making visual improvements and customizations on one's desktop. It was inherited from the practice of customizing cheap Asian import cars to make them appear to be faster than they actually were - which was also known as "ricing". Here on /r/unixporn , the word is accepted by the majority of the community and is used sparingly to refer to a visually attractive desktop upgraded beyond the default.

 TL;DR, your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. I maintein this repo
 as *my* dotfiles.

## Thanks

 I've been lurking around /r/unixporn and dotfiles repos in Github from the past
 months and decided to build my own and make it public to help other people in
 the same situation I were in the beginning.

 To a total newbie, it could be very hard, slow and sometimes stressful make a
 decent, coherent and visuallyng pleasing customization. I really hope my ricing
 could give you some directions and insights in making your own.

 In that sense, I would like to thank [Luke Smith](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz)
 for his [dotfiles](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice) and his
 [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA).
 [Alex Booker](https://github.com/bookercodes) for his wonderful tutorials on
 [i3wm](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5ze0DjYv5DbCv9vNEzFmP6sU7ZmkGzcf)
 and the anons in [unixporn subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/).
